# Reward UI
User Interface for the research project using Jibo the robot. 

There were two versions created for this interface. One used a sliding coins approach and other used coins in a bucket. The purpose was to show this to children when they finish an assignment as a way to incentivize them to complete them. We have our robot a 'personality' that was defined in terms of its Energy, Mood, and Curiosity, all of them represented a number between 1-10. The purpose was to have the children use the coin to increase Jibo's Energy, Mood or Curiosity.

This code has the version of sliding coins, see the demo [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ymxj5HduLCfxOsyBpDs-On_ZCayV46up/view?usp=sharing)
